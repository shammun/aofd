## ch00_dot_product_why (review 1, 2026-10-22)

Reviewer: movie-reviewer, with fresh eyes. I saw the movie only as frames.
Inputs: `movies/out/ch00/ch00_dot_product_why/{1080.mp4, en.vtt, index.html}`,
`movies/ch00/ch00_dot_product_why/{storyboard.yaml, script.md, timing.json, manifest.json, data/*.json}`,
`movies/src/ch00/DotProductWhy.tsx` (font sizes and readout strings only),
`reports/movies/ch00/ch00_dot_product_why/{qa.json, contact_sheet.png, frame_*.png}`, and the page images
Kundu p. 41 (`../Fluid Dynamics/chapters/pages/ch02/p068.png`), Kundu p. 52 (`p079.png`) and Vallis p. 5
(`chapters/pages/ch01/p025.png`). The user's question is U-A.17 in `reports/ch00_poc_user_feedback.md`.

My frames are in `reports/movies/ch00/ch00_dot_product_why/review/`:
- 57 frames 640 px wide, from 1 s to 169.8 s, tiled four to a sheet in `tile_01…15.png`;
- the s7 motion every 2 s (`tile_s7_motion.png`) and the steep-map switch every 0.5 s (`tile_steep.png`);
- full-resolution crops `crop_105_angle.png`, `crop_125_eq.png` and `crop_131_pin.png`.

### qa.json
Duration, size, codec (H.264 High, yuv420p, AAC, faststart), black (0 stretches), loudness (−16.2 LUFS, −4.5 dBTP),
flashes (0/s), captions (36 cues match the script), physics (25 functions reproduce their hashes) and equations
(9 present) all **PASS**.
- **Not PASS:** `"frozen": FAIL — frozen > 4 s: ['8.333333', '6.033333', '5', '5.3', '4.966667', '8.833333', '4.033333', '5.1', '13.133333', '14.5', '6.133333', '6.233333', '6.366667', '7.366667']`, so `"pass": false`.
- My own freezedetect run (480 px, −60 dB, 4 s) found these static stretches: 3.4–8.3, 12.5–16.7, 18.2–22.9, 33.6–42.3,
  50.1–54.6, 55.0–60.0, 73.7–82.8, 96.2–113.3, 134.2–140.4 and 161.8–170.0 s.
- Every one of them is narrated, with gaps of ≤ 0.8 s. The longest silence is the 1.15 s hold on the end card.
- The frames also show small elements appearing inside several of these stretches. For example, F = 20 N appears between
  75 and 80 s; |∇T|, u and the shadow appear at 97.5, 102.5 and 107 s.
- None of these stretches feels dead to a viewer. The weakest is 134–140 s (see N7).
- The skill's rule is "frozen > 4 s *without narration*". The gate fails only because `movie_qa.py` does not subtract the
  narrated time, so this is a tool false positive. It still blocks `qa_pass` (see M2).

### Teaching: does it answer U-A.17? PASS
- **The question comes first.** The question is on screen from frame 0 (0:00) and spoken by 0:11. The hook is inside the
  first 10 s.
- **The three answers from U-A.17 are all there, in order:**
  - **Symmetry (0:33–0:54).** The two shadows are 2.530 and 1.569. Each × the other length gives 8.000. The two product
    rectangles stand side by side in a tray with a 1 unit² grid. I measured them on the 640-px frames: widths 68 : 42 px
    (2.530 : 1.569 = 1.61), heights 85 : 136 px (3.162 : 5.099 = 0.62). So they are true to scale and equal in area.
  - **Cheap, and the shadow comes from it (0:54–1:13).** The recipe cards show the dot product, then the shadow = a·b ÷ |b|.
    Then b shrinks to b̂. The shadow stays at 2.530, and an intermediate frame reads "a·(orange arrow) = 2.530 × 2.982 =
    7.544". The gauge then reads a·b̂ = 2.530 = shadow. The wind example gives u·x̂ = 6.00 m/s.
  - **Physics needs both sizes.** Work: 50 J becomes 100 J while the shadow stays 10.0 N. Advection: 0.180 K/h becomes
    0.360 K/h while the shadow stays 5.00 m/s.
- **The sign (2:20–2:40).** The sign is covered at 60.3°, 90°, 120° (the shadow falls on b's line extended behind O,
  dashed) and 180° (the shadow is the whole of a pointing backwards, −16.125).
- **The voice.** It is informal and second person ("Here's a puzzle", "Mind the sign"). The script, captions and
  composition text contain no "clearly", "obviously", "trivially", "simply" or "easy to see". The narration is in our own
  words: Kundu's p. 52 sentence about "magnitude of one vector times the component of the other" is not paraphrased.
- **Scalars are never drawn as arrows.** a·b, W and u·∇T appear only as numbers, gauges or rectangles.

### Physics and maths honesty: PASS (one readout sign slip, M1)
I recomputed every number independently, and each one matches `data/*.json` and the frame:
- **The vector pair.** a·b = 5 + 3 = 8; |a| = √26 = 5.099; |b| = √10 = 3.162; θ = 60.255°.
- **The shadows.** Shadow of a on b = 8/√10 = 2.530; shadow of b on a = 8/√26 = 1.569. 2.530 × 3.162 = 1.569 × 5.099 = 8.000.
- **The rectangle corners** match `rect_on_b` and `rect_on_a`.
- **Work (s5).** 20 cos 60° = 10.0 N; W = 50.0 J, then 100.0 J. The rectangle depth matches the d arrow: 63 vs 62 px,
  and 130 vs 132 px after doubling.
- **Advection (s6).**
  - The shadow is 10 cos 60° = 5.00 m/s.
  - u·∇T = 5.00×10⁻⁵ K/s = 0.180 K/h. The steep map gives 1.00×10⁻⁴ K/s = 0.360 K/h, and its ∇T arrow is drawn twice
    as long (145 → 295 px at 1080p).
  - ∇T points east, towards warmer air, on a 10 → 16 °C field with isotherms every 100 km.
- **Advection (s7).**
  - −u·∇T is shown as cooling, and the upwind cone points south-west towards the colder side. This is correct for a wind
    from the SW.
  - The isotherms slide east 35, 70 and 108 km at 2, 4 and 6 h, which is 5 m/s × t.
  - The thermometer reads 13.00 → 12.78 (1.3 h) → 12.23 (4.3 h) → 11.92 °C (6 h), which is 13 − 0.18 t.
  - On the steep map it reads 15.91 (0.3 h), 15.55 (1.3 h) and 13.84 °C (6 h), which is 16 − 0.36 t.
- **The sign sweep (s8).**
  - 85.4° gives 0.413 and 1.306, consistent with the angle shown.
  - 90° gives 0.000.
  - 120° gives −2.550 and −8.062.
  - 180° gives −5.099 and −16.125 = −√260. The chip says −16.12 ÷ 16.12 = −1.000 → 180°.
  - b keeps |b| = 3.162 and turns anticlockwise, and the screen says "seen from above the page".
- **Colours and labels.** The colours are consistent all through: a, F and u are teal; b, d, ∇T, x̂ and b̂ are orange;
  negative products are rose and hatched. Every drawn object has a label.
- **Provenance.** The manifest pins fluidpy 6d2c52e. `vectors.py` is tracked, and `dirty_tracked` is false.

### Equation fidelity: PASS
- **(K 2.2)** (from 0:16). The page reads a·b = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ + a₃b₃ = Σᵢ aᵢbᵢ ≡ aᵢbᵢ (2.2), Kundu p. 41. The screen shows
  the first, second and last forms, which is allowed by the storyboard. It uses "=" where the page has "≡" (N2).
- **(0A.1)** a·b = |a||b| cos θ = (|a| cos θ)|b|. This matches Kundu p. 52, u·v = uv cos θ (unnumbered); the label is ours.
- **(0A.1, both ways)** and **(0A.1, solved for cos θ)** are correct rearrangements.
- **(0A.3)** |a| cos θ = a·b̂ = a·b/|b|, b̂ = b/|b|. This is ours and correct.
- **Vallis (1.7)** Dφ/Dt = ∂φ/∂t + (v·∇)φ. This matches p. 5. The page has upright D and bold-italic **v**; the movie uses
  \mathbf, which the storyboard notes. The (v·∇)φ term is boxed teal at 1:53.
- The line ∂T/∂t = −u·∇T when DT/Dt = 0 is correctly left unnumbered.
- W = F·d = |F||d| cos θ is correctly labelled "a definition from school mechanics (no book number)".
- No KaTeX error boxes appear in any frame.

### Legibility at 640 px: FIX (one overlap; sizes OK)
- The smallest font in the composition is 28 px at 1080p, about 9 px at 640 px. That meets the ≥ 28 px bar agreed in the
  PoC D re-review. Muted-grey 28-px notes ("1 grid square = 1 unit", "flat picture: the z-parts are 0", "assumes each
  parcel keeps its temperature…", the end-card "From Kundu…" line) are the hardest to read, but they are readable.
- **Overlap** at 1:42–1:57 (S1, below).
- **Contrast** at 2:08–2:20 (S2b, below).
- Nothing is clipped. The −16.125 gauge readout at 2:35 overhangs the left end of the gauge but stays inside the panel.

### Pacing: PASS
Every narrated claim is on screen at the moment it is said:
- 0:16 (K 2.2) · 0:22.8 (0A.1) · 0:28.3 shadow box;
- 0:37 and 0:41.5 the two shadows · 0:46 the rectangles · 0:50.8 "order doesn't matter";
- 0:59 "shadow = a·b ÷ |b|" · 1:03.7 b shrinks · 1:07 the wind;
- 1:17 to 1:31 the sled, shadow, 50 J and 100 J;
- 1:32.5, 1:37.7, 1:42.7, 1:47.3 and 1:53.3 ∇T, |∇T|, u, the shadow and the product;
- 1:57.8 the cone · 2:03.7 −u·∇T · 2:07.7 the steep map;
- 2:23, 2:27.7, 2:30.8 and 2:34.7 the holds at 60°, 90°, 120° and 180°.

The rate is 136.7 words per minute, so nothing is rushed.

### Captions: PASS
- 36 cues. The text equals the script.
- Lines are ≤ 42 characters; the maximum is 15.4 characters per second.
- Every cue lies inside the audio (0.30–168.85 s). Captions are not burned in.
- Two cues end on a one-word second line (N1).

### Accessibility: PASS
- Teal and orange are never the only cue: every arrow is labelled.
- Negative values are rose, hatched and dashed against neutral ink, never red against green.
- The map uses a dark-blue → purple → orange → yellow sequential map (thermal-like), not jet.
- 0 flashes. No full-screen noise. No black frames.

### Badges: PASS
"Not to scale" appears on every scene the storyboard lists as exaggerated:
- s4: wind arrow, 1 grid square = 1 m/s;
- s5: N and m on different scales, sled illustrative;
- s6: arrows not to the km scale, idealised field "illustrative (not data)";
- s7: time ×3600, arrows not to scale, idealised field.

s1–s3 and s8 have no exaggerations, and s9 is text only.

### Audio (vector "a")
I could not listen. Instead:
- `timing.json` shows the lexicon applied to all six spoken vector-a phrases ("Arrow [A](/ˈA/)", "arrow [A](/ˈA/)" ×3,
  "[A](/ˈA/) dot b" ×2).
- `KPipeline(model=False)` in `.venv-tts` gives the phoneme ˈA (misaki's "ay", eɪ) in each one. For example, "ˈɛɹO ˈA ɪz
  fˈIv" and "ˈA dˈɑt bˈi ˈOvəɹ ðə lˈɛŋθ ʌv bˈi".
- Lone "a" articles stay ɐ ("sˌO ɐ wˈɪnd"). u is jˈu, grad T is ɡɹˈæd tˈi, and x hat is ˈɛks hˈæt.
- The user should confirm by ear at 0:12, 0:28, 0:37, 0:41, 0:59 and 2:35.

### Integrity: PASS
- No book scans, crops or quoted text. All pictures are code-drawn.
- The end card names `viz/ch00/vector_products_lab.html` and `notebooks/poc_ch00a_dot.ipynb`, and both exist (but see S3).

### Findings

**Must**
- **M1 · 2:03.7–2:07.7 (s7 readout, still on screen until the steep map at about 2:08).** The line reads
  "= −5.00×10⁻⁵ K/s = −0.180 K/h **(4.32 K per day)**". The per-day value has lost its minus sign, in the scene whose
  whole point is the sign. The storyboard has "(−4.32 K per day)". The cause is `DotProductWhy.tsx` line 782, which prints
  `fx(adv.K_per_day, 2)` with `K_per_day = 4.32` positive and no rose "−". Fix: print "(−4.32 K per day)" with the minus
  in rose, like the two minus signs before it.
- **M2 · qa.json.** `pass: false` because of the frozen gate (quoted above). I judge every stretch narrated and none dead,
  but the movie cannot become `qa_pass` while qa.json says FAIL. Fix: make `movie_qa.py` apply the skill's rule (fail
  only on freezes > 4 s that overlap a narration gap > 4 s, using `timing.json`), then re-run QA after the M1 re-render.

**Should**
- **S1 · 1:42.7–1:57.6 (s6).** The "60°" angle label and its arc sit on top of the orange "|∇T|" bracket label above the
  ∇T arrow (`crop_105_angle.png`), so "|∇T|" is unreadable for 15 s. Fix: move the "|∇T|" label below the arrow (as the
  product rectangle's "|∇T|" is at 1:52), or put the 60° label above the arc's midpoint, at about 30° from ∇T.
- **S2 · 2:07.7–2:20 (s7 steep map).**
  - **(a) The thermometer jumps.** It goes from 11.92 °C (end of run 1) to 16.00 °C when the map steepens, and nothing
    says the clock restarts on a new map (`tile_steep.png`, 2:07.9 → 2:08.4). A first-time viewer may think the "cooling"
    warmed them by 4 K.
    - Best fix: build the steep map around the pin, T = 13 °C + 2 K/100 km × (x − 300 km), which runs 7 → 19 °C. Both runs
      then start at 13.00 °C and end at 11.92 vs 10.84 °C, so the doubling is visible.
    - Simpler fix: a chip "new map · clock restarts · 16.00 °C at you".
  - **(b) Low contrast.** On the steep map the orange ∇T arrow runs over the orange-yellow east half of the map and almost
    vanishes (`crop_131_pin.png`). Fix: give the arrows on the map a dark halo (the same `paintOrder` stroke the labels use).
- **S3 · 2:40.6–2:50 (end card).** The links are repo paths ("notebooks/poc_ch00a_dot.ipynb", "viz/ch00/vector_products_lab.html").
  Fix: show public addresses, e.g. "shammun.github.io/aofd/viz/ch00/vector_products_lab.html" and the notebook's HTML
  page. Keep "(until the Chapter 0A notebook is published)" only if that page will really exist when the movie goes public.

**Nice**
- **N1 · 0:11.975 and 0:33.25 (captions).** Two cues end with a one-word line: "Arrow a is five, one, and arrow b is one, /
  three." and "Reason one: a shadow depends on who casts / it." Re-break the lines ("Arrow a is five, one, / and arrow b
  is one, three.").
- **N2 · 0:16–0:54 (K 2.2).** The page has "≡ aᵢbᵢ" (a definition, by the summation convention); the screen has "= aᵢbᵢ".
  Consider ≡ to match the page.
- **N3 · 1:57.6–2:20 (s7 parcels).** The parcels are hollow white circles. The storyboard wanted each parcel to keep its
  own colour, which would *show* "keeps its temperature (DT/Dt = 0)". Fill each dot with its starting T colour.
- **N4 · 0:35–0:47 (s3 copies).** On the 640-px frames, 5 units of a span about 133 px in the left copy and about 142 px
  in the right. The storyboard says "same scale". Check the two copies' scale (the tray comparison is right either way).
- **N5 · 2:27.7–2:30.5 (90° hold).** The zero-width rectangle is drawn as a white line from O backwards along a's line. It
  can read as a new arrow. Hide the rectangle outline when its width is 0, and keep only the "0.000" readout.
- **N6 · 1:29–1:32 (s5).** The storyboard has the sled sliding on to 10 m; only the d arrow grows. That is fine, but a
  short slide would match "walk twice as far" better.
- **N7 · 2:13–2:20 (s7 card).** The two-row card is static while it is read out. Highlight row 1 on "The shadow says…"
  (2:13.05) and row 2 on "The dot product says…" (2:16.7).

### Verdict: FIX
The teaching, physics, equations and pacing are right, and the movie answers U-A.17 clearly. To reach `qa_pass` it needs:
1. one re-render for M1 (and preferably S1–S3);
2. the frozen-gate tool fix and a QA re-run (M2).

The re-review only needs frames at 1:42–1:57, 2:03–2:20 and 2:40–2:50, plus the new qa.json.


## ch00_dot_product_why (review 2, 2026-10-22)

Re-review after fix loop 1 (re-rendered MP4, 170.005 s, 13.16 MB). New frames are in
`reports/movies/ch00/ch00_dot_product_why/review2/`:
- `t_1…6.png`: 640-px frames at 18, 25, 36, 44, 47, 103, 106, 110, 116, 120, 124, 126, 127.6, 128, 128.5, 130, 133, 136,
  139, 148, 149, 158, 162 and 166 s;
- `n4_grid.png`: a full-resolution s3 frame with a 100-px grid laid over it.

I also swept the new contact sheet for regressions.

### qa.json: 10/10 PASS, `pass: true`
The frozen gate now reads "14 frozen stretch(es) > 4 s, all narrated (longest silence inside 0.80 s)", which is the
skill's rule. The other nine gates are unchanged: −16.2 LUFS, −4.5 dBTP, 0 flashes, 36 cues, 25 hashes, 9 equations.
**M2 closed.**

### Round-1 findings
| id | window | now | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | 2:03.7–2:20 | "(−4.32 K per day)" on run 1 and "(−8.64 K per day)" on the steep run. The values come from the signed `dTdt_K_day*` in the data. | PASS |
| M2 | qa.json | The frozen gate is narration-aware: PASS. | PASS |
| S1 | 1:42.7–1:57.6 | "\|∇T\|" now sits below the ∇T arrow (1:43, 1:46, 1:50). The "60°" label and arc are clear. | PASS |
| S2a | 2:07.7–2:20 | The steep map is built around the pin and runs 7 → 19 °C on a fixed 4–20 °C colour bar. The pin colour does not change at the switch. The chip "same place, gradient ×2 — clock restarts" appears from 2:07.6. The thermometer resets 11.92 → 13.00 °C (the chip explains this) and ends at 10.84 °C. | PASS |
| S2b | 1:42–2:20 | The ∇T and u arrows have a dark halo and stay visible over the orange east half (2:08.5, 2:10, 2:13). | PASS |
| S3 | 2:40.6–2:50 | The end card shows `https://shammun.github.io/aofd/notebooks/poc_ch00a_dot.html`, `https://shammun.github.io/aofd/viz/ch00/vector_products_lab.html` and the fluidpy ch02 URL. | PASS (see P1) |
| N1 | 0:11.975, 0:33.25 | "Arrow a is five, one, / and arrow b is one, three." and "Reason one: a shadow / depends on who casts it." No line in the VTT is over 42 characters. | PASS |
| N2 | 0:16–0:54 | "a·b = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ + a₃b₃ ≡ aᵢbᵢ (K 2.2)" now matches the page (Kundu p. 41) symbol for symbol, apart from the Σ form, which is omitted on purpose. | PASS |
| N3 | 1:57.6–2:20 | Each parcel is filled with its own temperature colour and outlined. Its fill matches the map under it, as it should for a field that is uniform in y. | PASS |
| N4 | 0:35–0:47 | Confirmed equal scale. In the full-resolution frame, a spans 400 px in both copies (O 400 → 800 and O 1240 → 1640), which is 80 px per unit. My round-1 figure of 133 vs 142 px was measured to the "a" label, not to the arrow tip. | PASS (no issue) |
| N5 | 2:27.7–2:30.5 | No rectangle at the 90° hold. Only the dashed drop line along a remains, plus the readout 0.000 and "perpendicular: no shadow". | PASS |

N6 (the sled does not slide) and N7 (the card rows are not highlighted) were not changed. They stay optional.

### Independent check of the new `s6_s7_advection.json`
- **Rates.** dTdt_K_s = −5×10⁻⁵ and −1×10⁻⁴; K_h = −0.18 and −0.36; K_day = −4.32 and −8.64. These equal
  −10 cos 60° × 1×10⁻⁵ (and ×2) × 3600 and × 86 400.
- **The steep map.** T_west_steep = 13 − 2 K per 100 km × 300 km = 7 °C, so the east edge is 19 °C.
- **Run 1.** T_pin at t = 0, 0.05, 0.3, 1 and 6 h is 13.0, 12.991, 12.946, 12.82 and 11.92, which is 13 − 0.18 t.
- **Steep run.** T_pin_steep at the same times is 13.0, 12.982, 12.892, 12.64 and 10.84, which is 13 − 0.36 t.
- **The other values.** The shadow is 5.00 m/s on both maps, and lut_range_C is [4, 20]. These match the frames.
- **On-screen readouts** match the series at the frame's sample: 12.60 at "2.3 h", 12.87 at "0.3 h", 12.33 at "1.9 h",
  11.25 at "4.8 h" and 10.84 at "6.0 h".

### Regression sweep: PASS
- The contact sheet and the frames show no new overlaps, clipping, KaTeX errors or colour changes.
- The s6 map now uses the 4–20 °C bar, so the 10–16 °C field reads purple to orange. Isotherm labels 11–15° are correct.
- s1–s5 and s8 are unchanged.

### New findings
- **P1 (publish condition, not a qa blocker).** The end card links to `https://shammun.github.io/aofd/notebooks/poc_ch00a_dot.html`,
  but no `notebooks/poc_ch00a_dot.html` exists in the repo yet; only the `.ipynb` exists. Build and publish that page, or
  point the card at a page that exists, **before** `/approve-movie` makes the movie public. I could not check the live
  site. `viz/ch00/vector_products_lab.html` exists in the repo.
- **Nice N8 · 1:57.6–2:20.** The clock prints t to 1 decimal while the series steps by 0.05 h. So "t = 0.3 h · 12.87 °C"
  sits beside 13 − 0.36 × 0.3 = 12.89 °C, a gap of up to 0.02 °C. Print t to 2 decimals, or step the series by 0.1 h.

### Verdict: PASS → `qa_pass`
The movie can go to drafts for the user to watch, with P1 to be resolved before it is published.

## Overall: PASS (ch00_dot_product_why review 2; P1 is a publish condition)
