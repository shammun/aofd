description: How aofd (Vallis) interactive explainers are designed in the unchanged Kundu/fluidpy format, with three.js 3-D added as one linked view inside Viz.app and standalone full-window 3-D scenes for dense ideas - 5–14 per chapter (Chapter 0 about 12 per part, soft), the Kundu exemplars rossby_waves / geostrophic_adjustment / ekman_spiral, new depth features (anatomy, magnitude bars, ghost-term, tank↔planet, figure-reader, 3-D view), the jet/rainbow ban, provenance chips, parity including 3-D and GPU rows; plus the fluidpy base - how explainers are designed, built, fitted to the window, verified and embedded - the explainer contract (5–10 per chapter), the assets/viz_lib.js API (Viz.app with linked views, transport, presets, status, terms, inspector, notes, the live Explain tab (explanation & interpretation), the step-by-step Derivation tab, synced code, modes, 3-D via three.js; Plot, field tools, particles, pager), the quality bar distilled from Shammunul's reference explainers (with their paths; the three Unit 4 mathlets are preferred), no-scroll layout rules, patterns for fluid phenomena, the lint/shot audit loop, and how show_viz and the publish tool put explainers full-window into notebooks, Colab and the web page. Load when choosing, storyboarding, building, reviewing or embedding an explainer.

# interactive-viz — explainers that fit the window and make an idea click

## 0. AOFD: the format is Kundu's (read this first; it overrides §1–§8 where they differ)
**§1–§8 below are copied verbatim from fluidpy @ d379326 and are the baseline** (PLANNING §8.2): one self-contained
`viz/chNN/<slug>.html`; a question as the title; linked views on one state and one clock; controls and presets;
transport (▶ ⏮ ⏭ ↺, scrubber, speed); status verdict; tabs Walkthrough (4–8) · Explore · Explain (≥ 3 numbered
sections with the reader's numbers, boxed results, regime-dependent interpretation) · Derivation (every D id the
curation assigns) · Equations · Code · Check yourself (≥ 3); ≥ 2 depth features; `selftest()` parity rows; no scrolling
at the 8 sizes and in a notebook frame; no text below 12 px; full-window block on the page. **Changes for AOFD:**
- **Count 5–14 per chapter** (`book.yaml → project.min/max_explainers_per_chapter`); **Chapter 0: about 12 per part
  (0A, 0B, 0C), a soft target** — tools warn, never fail; the curation says why when above or below. In §1 read
  "5–10" as "5–14". Parity `py:` expressions call `fluidpy.geo.*` / `fluidpy.core.*` / `aofd.*`, not `chNN.*`.
- **Metas** add `viz:3d` (0/1), `viz:kundu` (exemplar or re-skinned Kundu slug), `viz:data` (registry keys),
  `viz:badexample` (only for the labelled jet example in Ch. 0).
- **"This is the format" exemplars** — every builder opens these before building; the viz-reviewer compares against them:
  1. **`viz/ch13/rossby_waves.html`** <https://shammun.github.io/fluidpy/viz/ch13/rossby_waves.html> — crest ▲ vs
     group ◆ on one clock; chord = phase speed and tangent = group velocity on one ω(k) curve; a clicked column's
     vorticity budget traced in the walkthrough; 11 Explain sections; D22, D23 step-matched; 53 parity rows.
  2. **`viz/ch13/geostrophic_adjustment.html`** <https://shammun.github.io/fluidpy/viz/ch13/geostrophic_adjustment.html>
     — snapshot vs period-mean vs closed-form end state; conserved quantity drawn flat; energy bill (one third kept);
     "no rotation first, then the same step on a turning earth"; ★★★ D16 (11 steps); 67 parity rows.
  3. 3-D inside the app: `templates/viz_example_3d.html` (old r128 path) and **`viz/ch13/ekman_spiral.html`**
     <https://shammun.github.io/fluidpy/viz/ch13/ekman_spiral.html> — one depth cursor shared by the 3-D spiral, the
     hodograph and the transport integral (best-rated 3-D-ish pattern). New-kit references:
     `templates/viz_example_globe.html`, `templates/viz_example_vector_glyph.html` (skill `viz3d`).
  Local copies: `../Fluid Dynamics/viz/ch13/*.html` (read-only). The Unit 4 mathlets of §5 stay the preferred models.
- **three.js is added as a view, never as a different style** (§8b): a 3-D scene is one entry in `stage.views` created
  with `Viz3D.scene(view, …)`, sharing `app.state`, transport, presets, inspector, walkthrough steps, Explain numbers and
  the Code tab. Portrait phones: the 3-D view + one 2-D view, swapped by step. Optional `modes` entry "3-D / flat".
  Without WebGL the `Viz.proj3` fallback draws the key lines and every tab still teaches.
- **3-D wherever it eases understanding, in every chapter**: the curator decides per explainer (yes/no + one-line reason,
  "earn the third dimension"); a chapter with no 3-D explainer says why. Expected share ≈ ⅓–½. A dense scene becomes a
  **standalone scene** (§8c), linked both ways with its explainer.
- **New depth features** (count toward "≥ 2"): **anatomy** (clickable equation terms + hover cards, `Viz.symbols`),
  **magnitude** (log-scale term bars + dominant-balance badge, `Viz.magnitudeBars`), **ghost-term** (run with a term
  removed, `Viz.ghost`), **tank↔planet** mode, **figure-reader** (layers + probe + quiz, `Viz.figureReader`), **3-D view**.
- **Colour**: perceptually uniform only (cmocean/viridis/cividis), diverging centred on 0; **no jet/rainbow/hsv**
  (`viz_lint.py` fails them unless `viz:badexample`); project term colours (teaching-style §1l); glyph pairs teal/orange.
- **Honesty**: provenance chip on every data layer (*computed* fn / *schematic* / *data* key, period); exaggeration badges
  ("vertical ×1000", "1 s = 5 days", "not to scale"); `viz_lint.py` checks the chip on data layers.
- **Parity** adds GPU read-back rows (float32 rtol stated) and drawing invariants (cross product ⟂ inputs, Ekman transport
  ⟂ wind, isosurface volume vs Python ±2 %), and data-texture spot values (lat not flipped).
- **Flow-direction scenes** use the glyph language of skill `viz3d` (dot as shadow + signed bar; cross as parallelogram +
  arc + result arrow; curl as loop circulation + vertical arrow; where-from/where-to trajectory probe with yearly ticks).

## 1. The contract (checked by `tools/viz_lint.py`, `tools/shot.py`, `tools/embed_check.py`)
- **5–10 per chapter** (`book.yaml → project.min/max_explainers_per_chapter`), each tied to CORE ideas of
  `analysis/chNN_curation.md`, plus one backup idea in the curation in case one fails review.
- Equations are **shown, not just numbered**: any tour, Explain, Derivation or quiz text that refers to a book equation writes
  it out (TeX) next to its number.
- One self-contained file `viz/chNN/<slug>.html`, created with `tools/new_viz.py`; `assets/viz_base.css` and
  `assets/viz_lib.js` are inlined between marker comments by `tools/viz_inline.py` (edit the assets, never the copies).
  External resources: only KaTeX and (for 3-D) three.js, both loaded by the library from CDNs with fallbacks.
- `<meta name="viz:*">`: chapter, slug, order, title, summary, concept, sections, equations, fluidpy, **derivations**
  (the curation's `D` ids this explainer steps through, e.g. `D03 D04`, or `none`).
- **Fits the window with no scrolling** at 360×640, 390×844, 844×390, 768×1024, 1280×720, 1000×700 (notebook),
  1366×768, 1920×1080 — fills the window exactly, nothing overflows, no text below 12 px, tap targets ≥ 24 px.
- Tabs: **Walkthrough** (4–8 steps) · **Explore** · **Explain** (required: "Explanation & interpretation" — ≥ 3
  numbered sections + an interpretation) · **Derivation** (required when `viz:derivations` lists ids: every page of every
  derivation is audited) · **Equations** (book-numbered, live) · **Code** (required) · **Check yourself** (≥ 3) ·
  optional custom panels.
- **Depth features: at least 2 of** linked views (≥ 2), transport, presets, status, terms, inspector, notes, modes.
- `selftest()` rows: ≥ 2 `{name, js, py: "chNN.fn(…)", rtol}` (JS ↔ fluidpy parity, evaluated by shot.py) plus optional
  `{name, js, expect, rtol}` invariants.

## 2. `Viz.app(config)` — the API (full reference: header of `assets/viz_lib.js`; complete example: `templates/viz_example.html`)
```js
const app = Viz.app({
  title, subtitle,
  params: { k: { label: 'Wavenumber $k$', min: 0.05, max: 3, step: 0.01, value: 1, unit: '1/m', help: '…', optional: false },

});
```
- Inside callbacks use `g.app` (the outer `app` constant does not exist yet during the first draw). `g` is the first view;
  `g.view(id)` returns any view (`v.ctx, v.w, v.h, v.plot(), v.clear(), v.pointer`). `g.app.holding` is true while the
  transport holds at the end of a run (draw an end-of-run summary card then).
- Plot: `P.axes()`, `P.line`, `P.fn(f, {x0, x1, n, color, dash})`, `P.fillBetween`, `P.dot`, `P.arrow`, `P.text`, `P.clip`,
  `P.X/P.Y/P.ix/P.iy`. Fields: `Viz.field.grid/contour/drawContours/heatmap/streamline/quiver/particles`.
  Numerics: `Viz.num.linspace, trapz, rk4Step, odeint, brentq, erf, erfc, niceTicks, C`. `Viz.rng(seed)`.
- 3-D: `Viz.three(g.view('scene'), {distance, theta, phi, onPick(hit, ev)}).then(T => { if (!T) return; T.scene.add(mesh); T.render(); })`
  — drag orbits, wheel zooms, click picks; `T.project(vec3)` gives 2-D positions for labels on the view's 2-D canvas.
- Explain helpers: `Viz.work.step(n, title)` (numbered section) · `line(formula, value, why)` · `box(html)` /
  `result(html)` (boxed result) · `say(html)` · `hint(html)` · `interpret(html, label)` · `table(headers, rows, current)` ·
  `Viz.live(name)` (a value refreshed every frame from `explain.live`). Write it like the reference panels: what the views
  are (colours!) → each quantity computed from the controls → the values at the current time → what it means now.
- Derivation tab: pages are *the goal* (goal, start, plan, tools) · *step k* (we had → the move → now → Why → In words →
  your numbers → Watch) · *the result* (whole chain, result, what it means right now, check). A step's `set` moves the
  picture to the case being derived; on phones only `view` (else the first view) stays visible. A walkthrough step quotes
  one step with `derive: {id, step}` and links to the full derivation. Deep link: `#tab=derive&d=1&ds=3`.
- Pixel-space canvas helpers (after ch01): `Viz.font(px, weight, mono)`, `Viz.roundRect(ctx, x, y, w, h, r)`,
  `Viz.text(ctx, str, x, y, {size, weight, color, align, baseline, halo, bg, maxWidth})` (label on a solid box with
  `bg: true`), `Viz.card(ctx, cx, cy, lines, {color, colors, maxWidth, align})` (end-of-run card, wraps and stays inside
  the canvas).
- Formatting: `Viz.fmt(v, {sig, unit, keepTiny})`, `Viz.tnum(v, sig, {keepTiny})` in TeX (round-off below 1e-12 prints
  as 0 unless `keepTiny`), `Viz.fmtTime(seconds)` (µs … years). Colours:
  `Viz.color('accent'|'teal'|'orange'|'rose'|'blue'|'amber'|'muted'|'text')`, `Viz.alpha(c, a)`; coloured words in HTML
  with `<b class="c-teal">`. In JS strings double every TeX backslash — better, write every TeX-bearing string as
  `String.raw` (a lone `\f`, `\r`, `\t`, `\b` becomes a control character, `\m`, `\p`, `\s` a bare letter; see Lessons ch16).

## 3. Fit rules (how to pass the audit without shrinking anything)
- The engine: picks the layout (`wide` | `portrait` | `landscape`), raises density 0–3 (hides help lines, `optional`
  items, the Explore intro, view titles on phones), pages every long list (Explore, Explain, Derivation steps, Equations, Code in
  5-line chunks, Check, and the walkthrough card itself: a step's extras continue on "›"), shortens tab labels, hides the
  transport's step buttons and speed on phones, and flags views smaller than 60 px.
- **Pager, oversized items** (`Pager.layout`): an item taller than a whole page is never clipped — it is shown in
  slices, one per page, cut only at natural breaks (between paragraphs, text lines, list items, table rows, code rows, the
  rows of an `aligned`/`cases` formula; never through a line of text, a formula or a control). A slice that continues
  shows "continued on the next page ›" at the bottom; the next page starts with a "continued" rule. A single atom taller
  than a page (a huge formula) sets `P.tall`, and on portrait `fit()` gives the text more of the window
  (`data-room="text"`); views squeezed below 60 px make it give the picture more (`data-room="stage"`) — each kept only
  if it leaves fewer problems. Equations on hidden pages are scaled (≥ 0.78) like the visible ones. The portrait
  stage's floor also guarantees every visible view ≥ 60 px (`--viz-stage-need`: strip + transport + weighted rows);
  the stage grows into a short page but, when a page would not fit, stays at that floor (`data-paged`), so a page is
  never shorter than the height it was packed for; live notes/inspector that change height re-pack the pager. A
  text page under 110 px also raises the density (titles hidden on phones). **What is left for text is the explainer's
  budget**: at 360×640 a stage with a 2-line status, two view rows and a transport leaves ~60–100 px for the
  walkthrough card — hide a row on portrait (`hidePortrait`, or the scoped-CSS row hide), shorten the status, or
  accept many short pages.
- The audit pages through **every page of every pager** (walkthrough card, Explore, Explain, Derivation, Equations,
  Code, Check) at every size and fails on anything clipped or too wide on any page
  (`[phone] tour-step3: viz-step-card page 6/8: viz-der-mini '…' clipped 12px`, screenshot `CLIP__<size>__<view>__pgK.png`).
  Slicing is the safety net, not the design: a quote card that needs three slices on a phone is too long.
- You: step text ≤ 45 words; ≤ 2 extras per step; ≤ 5 controls in Explore (mark the rest `optional`); readout labels ≤ 22
  chars; at most 3 views, `hidePortrait` on the least important; wide equations use `\begin{aligned}`; code lines ≤ 70 chars;
  derivation lines short enough for a 1000×700 notebook iframe (the audit fails `equation-too-wide`) — split a long line
  into two steps or move the definition into *why*.
- Never add `overflow: auto`, fixed widths > 360 px or font sizes < 12 px in chapter CSS.
- Draw from `v.w`/`v.h`; `equal: true` for geometry; on small views reduce annotation density, not font size.

## 4. What a great explainer has (the quality bar — distilled from the references in §5)
1. **A question as the title** and a subtitle that says what is on screen.
2. **The phenomenon itself**, not just a chart — and ideally **several linked views of it** driven by one clock: the
   physical system, a graph over time/space, and a second representation (phase plane, response curve, profile, spectrum).
3. **A faint whole curve + a bold "so far" part**, a **ghost reference** (e.g. ω = 1, the undamped case, the inviscid
   limit) and **markers of the special points** (nodes, stagnation points, separation, critical values).
4. **Stages the reader can replay** — the walkthrough steps set the picture up; transport with play / step / scrub /
   speed; an **end-of-run summary** card.
5. **Show every number, then say what it means**: the **Explain** tab ("Explanation & interpretation", the
   `forced_damped_vibrations.html` panel) works every displayed quantity out with the current values in numbered steps
   ("formula = substituted = result — why", results boxed, colours matching the curves), gives the values at the current
   time, and ends with a regime-dependent interpretation; an **inspector** traces the exact arithmetic for a clicked point.
5b. **Derive the hard formula in front of the picture**: for derivation-heavy ideas, the **Derivation** tab builds the
   result one move at a time (we had → move → now → why → in words → your numbers), each step moving the picture to what
   it is about, ending with the whole chain, a check and the interpretation.
6. **Show the code**: the Python behind the picture with live values in the comments, lighting up line by line in the
   walkthrough.
7. **Decompose**: term-by-term bars that add up to the total (click a term to isolate it).
8. **Presets at the special cases** and a **status verdict** naming the regime ("🎯 resonance", "⚠️ overturning").
9. **"Right now" interpretation** that changes with the regime, a small table of real-world values with the current row
   highlighted, and "Things to try".
10. **The same idea in another system** (modes/tabs: a wheel, a spring, a house's temperature — or for fluids: a pipe, a
    river, the atmosphere) when that makes the idea general.
11. Consistent colour meaning across text, bars and curves; a legend line; every number with a unit.

## 5. Reference explainers (open the one your storyboard names before building; match its depth)
**Shammunul's preferred models are the three Unit 4 mathlets** (★ below). Every explainer should feel like them: the
phenomenon and its graphs side by side on one clock, sliders and toggles that change everything at once, and a live
"Explanation & interpretation" that computes every number step by step and says what it means.
| File | Study it for |
|---|---|
| ★ `G:\Differential Equations_OCW\Course I am Completing\1_Introduction to Differential Equations\Unit 4_Exponential Response and Resonance\forced_damped_vibrations.html` | **the explanation panel to copy**: phase plane (drag the initial state) + x(t) graph with steady state / transient / solution toggles (green / blue / orange) on one time slider; the "+ explanation" panel computes ω₀ and ζ with numbers, the regime and characteristic roots, p(iω) → amplitude → phase lag in boxes, the transient from the initial condition (half-life, 1 % time), the values "at the current time" (x = steady + transient), what each window shows, and a regime-dependent interpretation (below / near / above resonance); floats, minimises and pops out into a live tab |
| ★ `G:\Differential Equations_OCW\…\Unit 4_Exponential Response and Resonance\angular_frequency_explorer_1.html` | linked views (system animation · rotating pointer · 2π-window graph · response curves) on one clock, modes (wheel / spring / heat), presets, live working and regime-dependent notes with a highlighted table ("From ω to period", "Right now", "The 2π puzzle", "Things to try"), ghost reference, end-of-run summary, fits 100dvh |
| ★ `G:\Differential Equations_OCW\…\Unit 4_Exponential Response and Resonance\amplitude_phase_second_order_II_3.html` | system + graph + Bode + Nyquist windows linked by one state; crosshair readouts; the explanation is a **numbered derivation with live numbers** (1. evaluate p(iω) · 2. complex gain via the conjugate · 3. amplitude and phase · 4. period and time lag · 5. reading the current setting · 6. at time t) and each optional window gets its own section, or a hint to open it |
| `C:\Users\sislam27\Work\Climate Dynamics PHD\fast.ai\shammunul-fastai-notes\notebooks\interactive_viz\fid_formula_lab.html` | a formula whose terms are clickable, term-by-term bars and a total, stage chips, story text + code with the active line highlighted, a "make it perfect" preset |
| `…\interactive_viz\forward_noising_lab.html` | a closed-form jump shown as image + image = image, live coefficients, click a pixel to see its exact arithmetic, "variance is conserved" check line |
| `…\interactive_viz\pixels_as_parameters.html` | an algorithm in slow motion: forward → loss → gradient → step stages, step back/forward, a clickable loss curve to jump in time |
| `…\interactive_viz\random_copy_lab.html` | click-to-place interaction, before/after panels, code whose comments show the live random draws |
| `…\interactive_viz\overfitting_curves.html` | a minimal, very clear two-slider figure: dashed "future" remainder, a marker for the optimum, a verdict line that changes with the regime |
| `…\interactive_viz\stride_padding_playground.html` | presets that are the classic settings, the size formula with numbers plugged in, badges explaining the result, click an output cell to move the window |
| `…\interactive_viz\ddpm3_unet_3d.html`, `…\interactive_viz\np_resnet_3d.html` | three.js scenes: blocks you can orbit and click, a data token travelling through, pills to jump, an inspector card and code synced to the selected block, offline fallback note |
(`…` = `C:\Users\sislam27\Work\Climate Dynamics PHD\fast.ai\shammunul-fastai-notes\notebooks`. The published copies are at
`https://shammun.github.io/shammunul-fastai-notes/notebooks/interactive_viz/<file>`.) These references scroll or post their
height; ours must fit the window — take their *depth*, keep our layout.

## 6. Patterns that suit fluid mechanics
| Idea type | Views and features |
|---|---|
| a field (velocity, pressure, vorticity) | heatmap + streamlines + tracer particles; probe inspector with the velocity arithmetic; presets for classic flows |
| superposition / potential flow | toggles per element + the sum; stagnation points marked; terms for the complex potential parts |
| waves / dispersion | animated surface with particle orbits · ω(k) curve with a moving dot · a packet showing phase vs group speed; transport |
| boundary / similarity layers | profiles at several stations that collapse when rescaled (mode: raw / rescaled); status for separation |
| stability | growth-rate curve vs wavenumber · animated perturbation for the chosen k; status stable/unstable; presets at critical values |
| balances (geostrophy, Ekman, drag) | force arrows on a parcel with term bars that sum to zero; "turn off term X" presets |

## 7. Build → audit loop
`tools/new_viz.py` → write → `tools/viz_lint.py <file>` → `tools/shot.py <file>` (full: 8 sizes, every tab and step;
`--quick` while iterating) → **Read the PNGs** in `reports/viz/chNN/<slug>/` → compare with the reference → fix → repeat
(≤ 6 rounds).

## 8. Embedding (done by the notebook-builder and the publish tool)
- Notebook cell: `show_viz("chNN", "<slug>")` (via `nb.explainer(...)`). Local Jupyter/VS Code → `<iframe srcdoc>` of the
  file on disk; Colab → `<iframe src>` of the GitHub Pages copy (srcdoc from the clone if Pages is not live yet); the
  iframe is output-width × visible-window-height with Full screen / Open in new tab.
- Published page: `tools/publish_notebook.py` swaps each output for a `section.fp-viz` block sized to exactly 100 % of
  the window width and height; `tools/shot.py --page` verifies it. The GitHub `.ipynb` view shows a link card.

## 8b. AOFD: a 3-D view inside the app (details in skill `viz3d`)
- Scaffold: `tools/new_viz.py --3d chNN <slug>` (from `templates/viz_example_globe.html`). The scene source is written
  by the `viz3d-builder` in `viz/chNN/scenes/<slug>.scene.js`; `tools/viz_inline.py` inlines it together with
  `assets/viz3d.js`/`viz3d.css` and writes the three.js 0.186.1 **import map** into `<head>` of every file with
  `<meta name="viz:3d" content="1">`.
- Wiring (the `viz-integrator`): `stage.views` gets `{id: 'scene3d', …}`; in `setup` call `Viz3D.scene(g.view('scene3d'),
  {…}).then(S => …)`; `draw` updates layer params from `s`; transport ↔ `S.loop`; `S.pick` → `app.set`; walkthrough
  steps carry `camera:` presets and layer reveals; Explain/Code numbers come from the same JS mirror functions.
- Audit: `tools/shot.py --3d <file>` (GL flags, `?audit=1`, `viz3d:ready`, non-blank canvas at every size, real drags and
  wheel, forced context loss → message → restore, `renderer.info.memory` → 0 after dispose) **plus** the normal shot run.
  A 3-D explainer passes only if the WebGL canvas was really drawn (not the fallback note) and the fallback also works
  with WebGL disabled.
- Page level: one renderer per explainer, lazy (IntersectionObserver), released after 30 s off-screen; page audit ≤ 8
  live contexts after scrolling top to bottom.

## 8c. AOFD: standalone 3-D scenes (`scenes/chNN/<slug>.html`, PLANNING §15.1)
- For dense, immersive ideas an explainer can't hold (global circulation, overturning pathways cf. Figs. 21.6 / 21.30,
  polar-vortex isosurfaces, gyres on a globe, the ENSO thermocline). 0–4 per chapter (Ch. 0 up to 6); **not** counted
  toward the explainer cap; listed in `book.yaml → chapters[N].scenes`.
- Each has: a guided camera tour with timed caption cards ("what you are looking at"); play / pause / step and a few
  sliders; a slim side panel with plain words and the one key equation written out with its number; provenance chip
  and "not to scale" badge where exaggerated; links to the notebook section, the explainer and the movie.
- Same machinery: built on `assets/viz3d.js`; physics mirrors a tested fluidpy function with selftest parity rows;
  `shot.py --3d` at all sizes, reduced motion, WebGL-disabled fallback; then a viz-reviewer pass with the 3-D checklist.
- Integration: embedded full-window in the notebook/Colab/page next to its CORE block; a card on the chapter landing
  page; an entry in `scenes/index.html`. Scene modules are shared with movies (`@remotion/three`).

## 9. Lessons (the knowledge-keeper appends; one line each, dated by chapter)
- (machinery) The `#app` mount must be 100 % high or the no-overflow audit cannot see clipping; the audit also fails
  `app-does-not-fill-window`.
- (machinery) On 360×640 phones a multi-view stage needs the transport's step/speed controls hidden and the walkthrough
  card paged; the engine does both.
- (machinery) Seven tabs squeeze the title on a 768 px tablet: the header now falls back to short labels, then to a tab
  row of its own. On phones the Derivation tab keeps one view and hides the preset strip and transport.
- (machinery) Derivation lines wider than the side panel of a 1000×700 notebook iframe fail `equation-too-wide`: keep a
  line to one relation; put definitions (`ω_d = …`) in their own step or in *why*.
- (ch01) Never assign `ev.view` in a pointer handler (read-only `UIEvent` getter; it threw in every `onPointer`); use
  `ev.viewId` / `ev.vizView`. `shot.py` does not click yet: run a click/drag pass over every view and count page errors.
- (ch01) Two sign conventions: the status badge reads verdict word → the fluidpy criterion text in the chosen
  convention → the other convention's bare relation, at every size; pin it with exact-text selftest rows (E4).
- (ch01) A view hidden on portrait phones must not carry the step's key number: repeat it in a visible view's title or
  a readout ("Kn(body) 0.064 → slip flow"), and never tell phone readers to use controls that are hidden there.
- (ch01) A step that traces one sample's arithmetic sets the global parameter to that sample's value, and the badge,
  equation card and inspector compute the same quantity on the same basis (mean vs crest count disagreed in E1).
- (ch01) The Derivation tab has the notebook's step count and move titles; when either side splits a step, renumber
  every walkthrough `derive: {id, step}` link in the same edit (reviewer compares `app.cfg.derivations` with the builder).
- (ch01) Plain-text *why*/*watch* strings never contain raw TeX (write e^(±λt)); *why* ≤ 35 words.
- (ch01) Narrow views (< 420 px): draw the rotated y title in its own strip (the library clamps the left pad to 40 px
  and the title covers minus signs of ticks); move legends into the view title; below 60 px draw only the 0 tick.
- (ch01) Use `Viz.card` for end-of-run cards (wraps inside the canvas; a one-line card clipped on phones), `Viz.text`
  with `bg: true` for labels crossing curves, `Viz.fmtTime` for durations, `Viz.tnum(v, sig, {keepTiny: true})` for
  molecular-scale numbers. Units inside TeX use `m^{3}`, not "m³" (KaTeX warns).
- (ch14) **Drive the walkthrough with real clicks at least once per review** (`VIZ.goStep` hid a "Next →" that skipped
  every second step in every chapter); a pager keeps its page only when the caller asks (`setItems(list, true)`); a
  button built with `h(…, {onclick})` must not also get `.onclick`; audit a state change with Explain open.
- (ch14) A cited curve goes on the axis of the quantity it is a ratio of, with the ratio in its label; a model says
  "model" in title, plot, status and notes; never use a private `app._…` flag.
- (ch15) **Presets carry their distinguishing value in `set`** — the library marks a chip pressed when every key of
  `set` matches, so `set: {mode}` alone lights every chip of that mode; when the value depends on another parameter use
  a getter `get set() { … }` returning the same value as `action`. Check that exactly one chip is pressed after each preset.
- (ch15) **Size decisions from the view (`v.w`, `v.h`), never the window**: labels placed by a window-wide `narrow()`
  overlapped curves, handles and arrows on phones in six of nine files; reserve the top-right corner of a view for the
  canvas play button.
- (ch15) Every ratio on screen says what it is a ratio of; a printed slip is shown live beside the corrected form with
  the identity it breaks; an exaggerated motion is labelled with the factor and the true size ("×500, true ≤ 0.886 mm").
- (ch15) Derivation step titles are copied from `build_chNN.py --dump`, and a fix the lesson review makes to a
  derivation is re-briefed to the explainer that shows it (D20 step 4 was fixed in the notebook only).
- (ch16) **Every TeX-bearing JS string is `String.raw`** (or every backslash doubled): single backslashes in ordinary
  strings ate (16.63), (16.72), (16.77), (16.151) in three files — `\f` became a form feed (KaTeX error), `\r` a carriage
  return (silently wrong) — and lint and shot passed all three; until shot.py checks it, count `.katex-error` over every
  tab, step and derivation page and scan `app.cfg` strings and live outputs for control characters before handing back.
- (ch16) A model's validity range is part of the explainer: the status line names the threshold, computed from the
  fluidpy guard ("α_t > (1 − n/2)^{1/n} = 0.397: outside the tube-law fit"), and every preset lands inside it or says
  in its title that it does not.
- (ch16) Mirror closed forms, not nested root finders (Windkessel beat by beat, Starling x(α)): parity rows hold at
  1e-9…1e-12 and nothing can fail to bracket at an extreme slider setting.
- (ch16) A printed slip is a selectable mode with both numbers live and one parity row per form (Murray (16.140),
  Womersley (16.96), Dean c₄).
- (ch16) Parallel builders prefix every scratch file with their slug, write hand-back notes to disk, and never run a
  `build_chNN.py` to read its help (an old builder rebuilt the notebook on `--help`).
