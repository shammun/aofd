# teaching-style — make it click for a first-time reader

Distilled from Shammunul's own annotated notebooks (`fast.ai/shammunul-fastai-notes`, e.g. `18_fid_explained.ipynb`,
`14_augment_explained.ipynb`). The reader is smart, busy, strong in Python and statistics, and new to this physics.
**AOFD reader:** first-year calculus and **no climate background**. Sections §1–§5 are the fluidpy base (unchanged);
§1d–§1k are the Vallis additions (PLANNING §8.1, §9.1; R4 §1, §6.1). The lesson-reviewer checks all of them.

## 1. The logic chain (every CORE idea, in this order)
1. **The problem in plain words** — why anyone cares. A concrete scene first (a wave arriving at a beach, air over a
   wing, a pollutant in a river, the atmosphere over a mountain). No symbols yet.
2. **The idea** — the one mental picture that makes the result feel inevitable. An ASCII sketch or a two-column table
   often does it:
   ```
   deep water:  particles move in circles ──► shrink with depth like e^{kz}
   shallow:     particles move in flat ellipses ──► the bottom squashes them
   ```
3. **The maths, step by step** — one algebraic move per line, each with a short reason ("substitute (7.22) into the
   Laplace equation", "the sinh cancels"). Define every symbol with its unit the first time it appears. Show every
   book equation you use **in full together with its number**, e.g. $c = \sqrt{g/k}$ *(Eq. 7.27)*; never refer to an
   equation by its number alone — not in prose, derivation steps, traps, recaps or explainer text (a repeat mention
   may use a compact inline form, but the equation is still written). Anything longer than a line or two is a full **derivation** (§1c).
4. **A tiny example with easy numbers** — traced by hand before any code: H = 1 m, k = 1 m⁻¹, g ≈ 10 m s⁻². Show the
   intermediate numbers. The reader should be able to check it on paper.
5. **Code** — short cells that call the tested `fluidpy` function; every line commented for a novice.
6. **What the output shows** — never leave a figure or number uninterpreted.

## 1b. Nothing unexplained (the self-contained rule)
Every A-depth (load-bearing) idea of the chapter is a CORE block with code and a visualization; B ideas are stated
and explained inside the nearest CORE block, C ideas named with a pointer (`book.yaml → policy`). Beyond that, **every concept, term, symbol,
mathematical tool and Python function/idiom is explained no later than the cell where it is first used** — by its own
CORE block, by a 🔁 recap of an earlier chapter, or by a 📎 primer right there. Typical primer candidates:
- maths: partial derivatives, gradient/divergence/curl, the chain rule in several variables, Taylor expansion, complex
  exponentials, Fourier modes, eigenvalues, integrals over surfaces and volumes, order-of-magnitude estimates, logarithmic axes;
- physics vocabulary: control volume, steady vs unsteady, inviscid, incompressible, boundary condition, dimensionless group;
- Python: numpy broadcasting, `np.meshgrid`, vectorised `np.where`, `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, `scipy.optimize.brentq`,
  `matplotlib` contour/quiver/streamplot, f-strings, `lambda`, `assert np.allclose`.
Primer format (`nb.primer(term, text, code)`): one or two plain sentences, what it means *here*, and for maths or Python a
2–4-line runnable demo with easy numbers. If an earlier chapter already primed it (`knowledge/primers.md`), write one
reminder sentence and name the chapter instead of repeating the primer. When unsure whether the reader knows something,
prime it — a two-line primer costs less than a lost reader.

## 1c. Derivations — every move shown, every move explained (hard maths made easy)
Whenever a result is obtained by manipulating equations (more than one line of algebra or calculus from things the
reader already knows), it is a **derivation** (`D01…` in the curation) and is written out in full — in the notebook
(`nb.derivation`, so also in Colab and on the web page) and, when an explainer covers that idea, in the explainer's
**Derivation** tab with the same steps.
- **Say the goal first, in plain words**, and why we want it ("show that friction can only remove energy"). Then **the
  plan** in 2–4 bullets ("multiply by the velocity; spot two exact derivatives; read off the sign"), then **the tools**
  it uses (each already taught, recapped or primed — a tool first used inside a derivation gets its primer *before* it).
- **One small move per step.** Never "it can be shown", "after some algebra", "similarly", "clearly". If a step needs
  two moves, it is two steps. Hard derivations (★★★) may have 10–15 steps; that is fine.
- **Every step has four parts**:
  1. *What we did* — the move in a few words ("divide both sides by $m$", "integrate from the wall to $y$").
  2. *The new line* — the equation after the move; keep it short enough for a phone (split long lines).
  3. *Why we can do this* — why the move is allowed (name the rule: chain rule, product rule, divergence theorem,
     $e^{rt} \neq 0$, "the pressure does not depend on $x$ here") **and** why we make it (what it is heading toward).
  4. *In words* — what the new line says physically, in one sentence.
- **Say every assumption the moment it is used** ("steady, so $\partial/\partial t = 0$"; "inviscid, so the viscous
  term drops") and mark approximations with ≈ and the reason ("$kH \ll 1$, so $\tanh kH \approx kH$").
- **Colour-code terms consistently**: the same term has the same colour in the derivation, the explainer's bars and
  curves, and the figure legend (e.g. pressure orange, viscous rose, inertia teal).
- **After the result: check it, then interpret it.** Units of both sides; one or two limits or special cases that the
  reader knows ("$\zeta = 0$ gives energy conservation"); a sympy check cell for ★★★ derivations (`check_src`, every
  line commented); a number with easy values; then **what it means** and when it fails.
- **Link the derivation to the picture**: which curve, bar or readout shows the result, and one "try this" in the
  explainer (a derivation step may `set` the explainer to the case being derived).
- Avoid the classic traps: sign flips when moving terms, dropping a factor 2 from a square, differentiating a product
  without the product rule, swapping the order of integration and differentiation without saying why it is allowed.

## 1d. The Chapter-0 voice (Chapter 0 and the plain-words parts of every chapter)
- **Informal, blog-like, conversational**, as if talking to a curious friend: "Imagine you are standing on a hillside in
  fog…". Start from scratch; second person; contractions are fine.
- **Short blocks, each with a heading, one idea per block.** A block is 2–6 short paragraphs or one picture + its words.
- **Every symbol is introduced the moment it appears** (name in words, unit, a typical Earth value, atlas link §1i).
- **Everyday analogies, each with where it stops working** (§1f).
- **Precision is not given up — it comes in order:** the friendly paragraph → the exact statement (equation written out
  with its number, e.g. (B.3.9)) → a tiny worked number (easy | exact, §1h) → code (§1j).
- Sentences you could say aloud. **Never "clearly", "obviously", "trivially", "it is easy to see", "simply".** No
  unexplained jargon: every technical or climate word is defined on first use (§1k-rule below and the glossary).
- The 3B1B/Victor ladder (R4 §0–§1): one concrete case with numbers → a sweep over one parameter (faint family + bold
  current) → the rule. Ask for a **prediction before revealing** ("before you scroll: which way will it turn?").

## 1e. Equation anatomy and magnitude (every balance)
- Under every displayed balance in a CORE block: an **anatomy strip** — one braced label per term with its plain name,
  physical role ("pushes from high to low pressure") and colour family (§1l). In the notebook via `nb.anatomy(...)`.
- Every scale-analysed equation gets a **term-magnitude table or log-scale bars** with Earth values (`nb.magnitude_table`),
  names the **dominant balance** ("geostrophic: Coriolis ≈ pressure gradient") and the nondimensional number that *is*
  the ratio of two bars (Ro = advection ÷ Coriolis).
- **When it breaks**: every tool and balance ends with its failure case (geostrophy near the equator and at Ro ~ 1;
  hydrostatic when H/L is not small; linearisation at large amplitude) — ideally shown by a bar growing.

## 1f. Analogy with its limit — Like… / Unlike…
Every analogy is a two-row card: **Like…** (the everyday picture) / **Unlike…** (exactly where it fails). A mechanism
block also states its misconception (§2 🌍 block). Example: PV — *like* a skater pulling in her arms; *unlike* it, PV is
conserved only for adiabatic, frictionless flow and involves stratification as well as spin.

## 1g. Read the figure before interpreting it
Every data figure gets the **🗺️ reading card** (`nb.reading_card(...)`, R4 §3.1) *before* any interpretation:
1. What is plotted (quantity, unit; raw / anomaly — relative to which base period / climatology — which months, years;
   zonal or time mean?) · 2. The axes and projection (does the vertical axis point down? p, log p, z, depth, density?) ·
3. How value is encoded (colourbar range and centre, contour interval, dashed negatives, arrow scale, stippling) ·
4. The one big feature, in one sentence, with one number read off the figure · 5. Which physics explains it, and a
   "what would change if…" prediction · **Where it comes from** (observation / reanalysis / state estimate / model, and
   why that matters). Captions state product, period, base period, unit, projection and the ψ sign convention.

## 1h. Rotation sense, hemisphere — and two scales of numbers
- **Never write "clockwise" without the hemisphere and the viewpoint.** Prefer *cyclonic / anticyclonic* and add the
  clock sense in brackets: "cyclonic (anticlockwise seen from above in the NH, clockwise in the SH)".
- **Easy | exact numbers side by side**: Ω ≈ 7×10⁻⁵ | 7.29×10⁻⁵ s⁻¹; a ≈ 6400 | 6371 km; g ≈ 10 | 9.81 m s⁻²;
  f₀ ≈ 10⁻⁴ | 1.03×10⁻⁴ s⁻¹ at 45°; N ≈ 10⁻² s⁻¹; H ≈ 7 km; ρ ≈ 1 | 1.2 (air), 1000 | 1025 kg m⁻³ (sea water).
  Every derived number reads "≈ 10 m/s | 9.6 m/s" and is followed by **"that is like …"** (walking speed, a day, the
  width of a country).

## 1i. Symbols from the atlas, words from the glossary
- A symbol's first use links to its `knowledge/symbols.yaml` entry (name, say-it, unit, typical value, meaning); any TeX
  symbol not in the atlas and not defined in the same cell is a coverage warning.
- **No climate background assumed.** Every climate term (cyclonic, reanalysis, isopycnal, Sverdrup, anomaly, geopotential
  height, …) is defined on first use from `knowledge/glossary.yaml`, or primed right there. Read every block as someone
  who has never seen a weather map.
- Convention differences with Kundu or common practice get a `> ⚠️ Which convention?` callout (the "Which p_o?" pattern
  of §6): latitude symbol, ψ sign, lapse-rate sign (Kundu Γ = dT/dz computed, met Γ = −dT/dz always shown), b vs ρ′.

## 1j. From scratch, then the library (every computable equation — skill `from-scratch-code`)
Every computable numbered equation (A and B items, K-recaps too) gets, in this order:
1. `🐍 From scratch — eq (2.xx)`: inputs with units → **one operation per line** → a novice comment per line → result.
   numpy basics only; a loop first when that teaches, then the vectorised form; no hidden library call (not even via `aofd`).
2. `🐍 The library — fluidpy.geo.<module>.<fn>(...)` with the same inputs.
3. `np.testing.assert_allclose(scratch, lib, rtol=…)` with the tolerance justified in a comment.
4. An equation-code ledger row (eq → cell tag `eq:2.xx` → status) at the end of the section.

## 1k. K-recap blocks (🔁 From Kundu — skill `cross-book-continuity`)
At the **first Vallis use** of an idea Kundu taught: a full re-teaching at CORE depth — link line (notebook section,
explainer, Kundu derivation id + step count), notation crosswalk table (Kundu ↔ Vallis symbols, sign conventions), plain
words → (K n.m) written out and its Vallis form (n.m) → derivation steps re-typed in Vallis notation → tiny example →
scratch code + the existing `fluidpy.core` function + assert → figure or the Kundu explainer embedded → **"What Vallis
adds"**. Later uses: a short 🔁 recap naming the Vallis chapter where it was re-taught and the Kundu link.

## 1l. Project term colours (global, not per chapter; R4 §1.3)
| Term family | Colour |
|---|---|
| time tendency ∂/∂t | slate |
| advection u·∇ | teal |
| Coriolis / rotation | violet |
| pressure gradient | orange |
| gravity / buoyancy | brown |
| friction / diffusion | rose |
| forcing / heating | gold |
| β / planetary vorticity gradient | indigo |
The same colour in notebook LaTeX (`\color{}`), anatomy strips, bars, curves, 3-D glyphs and legends. Dot/cross glyph
pairs are teal (a) / orange (b) (skill `viz3d`).

## 2. Recurring blocks (use these exact headings — readers learn to scan for them)
- `**What is this section about?**` — 2–4 sentences at the top of a big section.
- `**What does the code above do?**` — after any non-trivial code cell: a numbered list of what each part does, in the
  order it runs, naming the variables.
- `**What does this show?**` — after a printed result: what the number/shape means, with a quick sanity check
  ("512 = one mean per feature").
- After every figure: `**What you see.**` · `**How to read it.**` · `**What would change if…**` (one concrete change
  and its predicted effect — ideally something the reader can try).
- `#### 🧮 Derivation — <result> (Eq. N.M)` (written by `nb.derivation`): What we want to show · The plan · Tools we
  use · We start from · Step k of n — <move> (line · *Why we can do this* · *In words*) · Result · What it means · Check it.
- `### ✏️ Tiny example: …` · `### 🎮 Interactive: <what it makes clear>` followed by `**What to try:**` bullets, each an
  action + what to watch for ("Drag H down to 1 m and watch the orbits flatten into ellipses").
- `> ⚠️ Common confusion:` callouts for misconceptions (phase vs group velocity, ν vs μ, streamline vs pathline).
- `### 🧩 <CORE idea>` opens every A-depth idea (B/C items sit inside it as 📝 notes); `> 📎 **Primer — term.**` and `> 🔁 **Recap — idea** (Ch. N §N.M).` blocks explain prerequisites where they are needed.
- `## ✅ What should have clicked` at the end: one bullet per CORE idea, each a sentence the reader could now explain to a friend.
- **AOFD additions:**
  - `### 🌍 Mechanism — <name>` (`nb.mechanism`, R4 §4): **Story** (2–3 sentences, no symbols) · **Picture** (one
    diagram or a tank ↔ planet pair) · **One equation** (anatomy strip, Vallis number) · **Number** (easy | exact) ·
    **Misconception** (the wrong idea, why tempting, why wrong — the physics must actually be right) · **Where next**
    (the Vallis section that derives it, the data figure that shows it).
  - `> 🗺️ **How to read this figure**` (`nb.reading_card`, §1g) — always before the interpretation.
  - `> 🔁 **From Kundu ch13 §13.5 — thermal wind**` (`nb.kundu_recap`, §1k).
  - `🐍 From scratch — eq (n.m)` / `🐍 The library — fluidpy.…` (`nb.scratch_vs_lib`, §1j).
  - `> **Like…** / **Unlike…**` (§1f) · `> ⚠️ Which convention?` (§1i) · `🎬 Movie` and `🧊 3-D scene` link lines next
    to the CORE block they serve.

## 3. Code comments (novice-grade, never noise)
```python
k = 2 * np.pi / wavelength          # wavenumber k [1/m]: how many radians of phase per metre
omega = np.sqrt(g * k * np.tanh(k * H))   # Eq. (7.36): the dispersion relation — frequency set by k and depth H
c = omega / k                       # phase speed [m/s]: how fast a crest moves
```
Comment the *meaning* and the unit, cite the equation; don't restate Python syntax ("# assign x").
From-scratch versions: a transparent loop or formula next to the library call, then
`assert np.allclose(mine, fluidpy_result)  # same numbers → the library does exactly this`.

## 4. Tone and format
- Second person, present tense, friendly and exact. Short paragraphs (≤ 4 sentences). Bold the one phrase to remember.
- Tables for comparisons (regimes, limits, methods: | Method | Problem |). ASCII diagrams for pipelines and geometry.
- Emoji as section markers only (⚙️ setup, ✏️ example, 🎮 interactive, ⚠️ confusion, ✅ summary) — never decoration in prose.
- Units always (SI); numbers with sensible significant figures; say "≈" when rounding.
- Our own words only: never paraphrase the book sentence by sentence, never copy its figures, tables or exercises.
  Equations are fine, with their numbers.
- Link backwards and forwards: "this is the same Laplacian you met in Ch. 4", "Ch. 13 will add rotation to exactly this".
  For Shammunul, name climate/ocean/atmosphere connections when they are real (geostrophy, Ekman, Rossby, stratification).

## 5. Walkthrough text inside explainers
- 4–8 steps; each step ≤ 45 words, one idea, and it *does something* to the picture (`set:` values, an animation, a
  highlight). Step 1 asks the question in plain words; the middle steps build the idea and show the equation with live
  numbers; the last step hands the controls over with a prediction challenge ("Predict first, then drag…").
- Use "you" and imperatives: "Drag the depth slider…", "Watch the red dot…".
- Check-yourself questions must be answerable by experimenting with the explainer, and the answer explains *why*.
- **Explain tab** ("Explanation & interpretation", modelled on `forced_damped_vibrations.html`): numbered sections that
  compute every number on the screen with the reader's settings (formula → numbers substituted → result, with a short
  why), coloured words that match the curves, a hint for any view hidden on phones, the values at the current time, and
  a regime-dependent **Reading the current setting** paragraph.
- **Derivation tab**: the same steps as the notebook's derivation (§1c), each step ≤ 35 words of *why* and one sentence
  *in words*; add `live` (the line with the reader's numbers) on the step where numbers help most.

## 6. Lessons (the knowledge-keeper appends; one line each, dated by chapter)
- (ch01) **Conventions, both on screen.** Lapse rate: compute with Kundu's Γ ≡ dT/dz (Γ_a ≈ −9.8 K/km, stable when
  Γ > Γ_a) and always show the meteorology Γ ≡ −dT/dz (+9.8 K/km, stable when Γ < Γ_a) alongside — a two-row table, a
  worked conversion (negate the number, flip the inequality, P48) and both forms in every slider legend and badge.
- (ch01) **"Which p_o?" pattern** for any book-vs-field-vs-code convention difference: state each convention, give the
  size of the difference in numbers (θ at the ground 287.07 vs 288.15 K), say which one the code uses and why — as a
  `> ⚠️ Common confusion:` callout next to the first use.
- (ch01) ★★★ sympy check cells re-run the derivation's own construction (build what step k builds, then test it), not
  only the final result — the reader sees the moves verified, not just the answer.
- (ch01) Make an approximation measurable: a small table of "linearised vs full" with the gap growing with amplitude
  tells the reader when the assumption fails.
- (ch01) Every number in prose is computed by a cell (or checked against one); after renumbering derivation steps,
  check every "Dxx step N" pointer by script.
- (ch01) A tool first used inside a derivation (∂, ∇, complex roots and cosh, the double root, Maxwell relations) gets
  its 📎 primer *before* that derivation; forward pointers to a later block say "(worked with numbers in C70 below)".
- (ch01) Figure annotations that the reading notes never mention (stray symbols, point letters) are removed or explained;
  a comment's claimed range must match the plotted data.
- (ch01) Reusable derivation moves (name them in *why*; recap by pointing to the chapter's D row):
  divide Newton's second law by the body's **own** mass/density, then Taylor-expand the surroundings to first order
  (D18) · eliminate a path function (dq) between two relations to leave state-function relations (D10) · set ds = 0 in
  both Gibbs forms and divide them so the unknown cancels (D14) · introduce g = h − Ts to get a Maxwell relation that
  trades an unmeasurable derivative for a measurable one (D19) · log-differentiate a product of powers into a sum of
  relative rates (D36) · try e^{λt} to turn a linear ODE into algebra, and treat the double root separately (D18) ·
  integrate pressure over a box's faces: sides cancel, top minus bottom is the net force (D05, D37) · "dimensionless ⇔
  exponent vector in the null space", then rank–nullity counts the groups (D28) · Poisson variance = mean gives relative
  scatter 1/√N (D35).
- (ch14) A "first look" primer for a concept a later block owns (formula, five numbers, a pointer) removes a forward
  reference; name arrows once where they are largest and state any exaggeration; a derivation header shows the derived
  line, not the starting one.
- (ch15) **Bridge the book's parameter and the field's slice by slice** (the lumped f = F/(p₁A) against 4f_F L/D: a
  one-line differential, then both numbers for the same duct, 0.100 against 0.532) — the "which p_o?" pattern for
  parameters, not only signs.
- (ch15) Prove an inequality by factoring a ratio and showing each factor is smaller (p_d/p₀ = (p₀₂/p₀₁)(p/p₀₂)); a
  *why* never claims more than the line before gives.
- (ch15) Sliders and widgets open on the case the text reads (`active=values.index(1.4)`); a small-angle force inset
  states its exaggeration and the true size of the hidden component ("tilt drawn ×5; the true drag arrow would be 3.5 %
  of the lift").
- (ch15) Reusable derivation moves (recap by pointing to the ch15 D row): differentiate each law, divide by it, solve
  the small linear system — the common factor 1 − M² decides every sign (D12, D22, D23) · divide out the root you
  already know ("nothing happens") (D13) · keep every cube when lower orders cancel exactly (D17) · write all laws in one
  dimensionless number until the problem is one parameter and a quadratic (D21) · a vanishing discriminant is the
  critical state (D24) · slide along a line to reduce a 2-D jump to a 1-D one (D26) · one small-angle replacement per
  step (D28, D31) · sum infinitesimal turns, substitute t² = M² − 1, split into arctangents (D29, D30).
- (ch16) **A quantitative word in a reading note gets a printing cell above it** ("6 decades", "6 × 10¹³", "+71 %"):
  the round-1 lesson review found eight adjectives that the numbers did not support.
- (ch16) Symbols the book introduces silently (p_e, transmural pressure, a₀) get a short definitions cell before the
  first derivation that uses them; a numerical demo separates the physics from the scheme's artefacts and starts from an
  exact state (a simple wave with u + 4c uniform, so no spurious left-going wave appears).
- (ch16) Reusable derivation moves (recap by pointing to the ch16 D row): work as a signed loop area by the shoelace sum
  (D01) · match two layers by stress and velocity continuity (D05) · volume balance + chain rule → first-order ODE →
  integrating factor → periodic state p(T) = p(0) (D09, D10) · cross-differentiate two first-order laws into a wave
  equation (D12) · try U(r)e^{iωt}, recognise Bessel's equation, drop Y₀ (D13) · keep the first non-cancelling term at
  small argument (D14) · stretch the wall coordinate and keep the decaying root (D15) · ∫sJ₀ = zJ₁ then X + iY (D16, D17)
  · minimise a⁻⁴ plus a²: pumping is half the upkeep (D22) · move a junction by ds: weighted unit vectors close (D24) ·
  regular perturbation series solved order by order with polynomial ansätze (D27) · a polynomial in √ξ for "considerable
  algebra" (D33).
